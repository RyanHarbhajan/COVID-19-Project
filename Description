# COVID-19-Project
SQL queries for analyzing COVID-19 data (Jan 2020-2022).

The original dataset used was from 'Our World in Data' (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

----
With this project, I wanted to showcase that data is in every aspect of our life, and sometimes, it’s more than just numbers on a screen. Also, although sometimes it can be worrisome and bleak, we can learn from it. Here, I wasn’t necessarily aiming to answer any specific questions, but rather, just explore the data, and see what I could take away from it.
